ClearCover Trust‑First Insurance Portal (Demo)

What this demo shows
- A visual insurance flow (Type → Plan → Proposal → Policy → Review)
- Plain‑English policy details that stay consistent across Portal / Agent / PDF (to reduce distrust)
- Versioning + mismatch simulation + reconcile to demonstrate a “single source of truth” concept
- A chatbot placeholder link you can point at your Custom GPT

How to run
- Open index.html in Chrome / Edge (no server needed)

How to configure your chatbot link
- Open app.js
- Update CHATBOT_URL to your Custom GPT URL (example: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-XXXX)
